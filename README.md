# Kaggle CORD-19 Challenge Notebook

This notebook attempts to look into various aspects relating the the transmission, environmental stability, and incubation period of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. 

Take a look at the notebook to see the findings and graphs created from the Kaggle CORD-19 competition data. You can also find my key findings and steps for improvement below. 

Key Findings:
- The survival of the COVID-19 virus varies when on different surfaces. On avergae, the virus can survive for 3-4 days on plastic and satinless steel surfaces, 1-2 days on cardboard, 3 hours in aerosol form, and 4 hours on copper.
- The virus can survive longer on hard surfaces compared to more porous surfaces. 
- Heat does seem to have some affect on the life of COVID-19 on plastic surfaces.
- The mean and median incubation period of the COVID-19 virus are 9.1 days and 6.1 days respectively according to the data used. 

Steps for improvement:
- The method used above to find virus survival on various surface and incubation period data is not perfect. A lot of information was missed, and some information was improperly used in my research. A more advanced technique of sifting through the large dataset will be required for more accurate findings instead of simply using regular experssions.
